**Song:** DRAKE x TRAVIS SCOTT Type Beat  SICKO TRAP  PROD  KUÌˆBE.wav

[INTRO]
lighter clicks
- you gotta do something with your life
- people say don't stick your head above the crowd
- am i going wrong way yeah?

wrong way yeah
am i going wrong way yeah?

[CHORUS] x2
am i goin' wrong way
am i goin' wrong way
i don't ever wanna sway ya

[VERSE 1]
fevered moth seeing bright ???
fell for paths that couldn't last
out of cost, out of lust - for asking questions  
pointless questions - just the vital ones
just the ones that would make you rise 
what you want, what you hide at

counting odds, myriads hold
- everything what you are
something's wrong, growing cold
tellin you to never fold
x
x
x

lift you is it wrong yeah?

[CHORUS] x2
am i going wrong way
am i going wrong way
i'm don't ever wanna sway ya

no pointless questions
just the vital ones, just the ones that would make you rise
what you want, what you hide at

tell me more 
i'll accept everything that you are
lift you is it wrong yeah? x2

am i going wrong way yeah?

[CHORUS] x2
am i going wrong way
am i going wrong way
i'm don't ever wanna sway ya

[VERSE 2]
light from the trenches
peaceful and vengeful 
at the top of the dimensions

repo of your mind
even the sadist in me wants it badly
my word against illusion
tell me more before oblivion

current moth of the present
did the things that wouldn't last
7 builds the future, sandcastles
thrown through time




------ version 2

[HOOK]

[VERSE 1]
fevered moth seeing bright 
fell for paths that wouldn't last
out of cost out of lust
i ain't asking more pointless questions 
just the vital ones, just the ones 
that will make you rise
what you want, what you hide at

counting odds, myriads hold
everything that you are

lift you is it wrong 
lift you is it wrong yeah?

something's wrong, 
i'm growing cold telling you to never ever fold

lift you is it wrong yeah?

fevered moth seeing bright 
fell for paths that wouldn't last
