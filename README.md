**Song:** DRAKE x TRAVIS SCOTT Type Beat  SICKO TRAP  PROD  KUÌˆBE.wav

[INTRO]
lighter clicks
- you gotta do something with your life
- people say don't stick your head above the crowd
- am i going wrong way yeah?

going wrong way
am i going wrong way yeah?

[CHORUS] x2
am i going wrong way
am i going wrong way
i'm don't really wanna sway you

[VERSE 1]
fucking moth from the past
did the things that wouldn't last
out of cost, out of lust
ain't asking any more pointless questions
just the vital ones, just the ones that will make you rise
what you want, what you hide 
tell me more 
i'll accept everything you are
lift you is it wrong yeah? x2

lift you is it wrong yeah?

fucking moth from the past
did the things that wouldn't last

more pointless questions
just the vital ones, just the ones that will make you rise
what you want, what you hide

tell me more 
i'll accept everything you are

lift you is it wrong yeah? x2

am i going wrong way yeah?

[CHORUS] x2
am i going wrong way
am i going wrong way
i'm don't wanna sway

[VERSE 2]
light from the trenches
peaceful and vengeful 
at the top of the dimensions
