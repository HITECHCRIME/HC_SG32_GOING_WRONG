Hitech Crime Single 'Going Wrong'

**Song:** DRAKE x TRAVIS SCOTT Type Beat  SICKO TRAP  PROD  KUÌˆBE.wav

[INTRO]
lighter clicks
- people say you gotta do something with your life
- people say don't stick your head above the crowd
- am i going wrong way yeah?

am i going wrong way yeah?

[CHORUS] x2
am i going wrong way
going wrong waaay
i'm not gonna sway

[VERSE 1]
fucking moth from the past
did the things that wouldn't last
out of cost out of lust
ain't asking any more pointless questions
just the vital ones, just the ones that will make you rise
what you want, what you hide
tell me more 
i'll accept everything you are
lift you is it wrong?

[VERSE 2]
light from the trenches
peaceful and vengeful 
at the top of the dimensions
