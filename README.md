Hitech Crime Single 'Going Wrong' Part I

**Song:** DRAKE x TRAVIS SCOTT Type Beat  SICKO TRAP  PROD  KUÌˆBE.wav

[INTRO]
lighter clicks
- you gotta do something with your life
- people say don't stick your head above the crowd
- am i going wrong way yeah?

wrong way yeah
am i going wrong way yeah?

[CHORUS] x2
am i goin' wrong way
am i goin' wrong way
i don't ever wanna sway ya

[VERSE 1]
fevered moth seeing light
did the things that couldn't last
out of cost, out of lust
for asking questions - pointless questions
just the vital ones, just the ones 
that would make them rise 
what they want, what they hide aye

counted odds, i accept everything what you are, 
lift you is it wrong?
lift you is it wrong yeah?

lift you is it wrong yeah?

my word against illusion
tell me more before oblivion
so i ask you

[CHORUS] x2
am i going wrong way
am i going wrong way
i'm don't ever wanna sway ya

current moth of the present
did the things that wouldn't last
7 builds the future 

no pointless questions
just the vital ones, just the ones that will make you rise
what you want, what you hide aye

tell me more 
i'll accept everything you are

lift you is it wrong yeah? x2

am i going wrong way yeah?

[CHORUS] x2
am i going wrong way
am i going wrong way
i'm don't ever wanna sway ya

[VERSE 2]
light from the trenches
peaceful and vengeful 
at the top of the dimensions

repo of your mind
even the sadist in me wants it badly
